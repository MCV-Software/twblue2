# TWBlue 2

This is a rebamped version of [TWBlue,](https://twblue.es) which pretends to support different social Networks and services, as well as make it easy to be ported to other operating systems by providing a separation between the application logic and the views by following the MVC pattern. Eventually, this codebase is going to replace the main TWBlue application, but for now it's just an experiment and the software is not even extensively tested.
